July 2011 my adventure racing teammate Susannah decided to run the Headlands 50 as a part of her training leading up to our 4 day expedition race in September (Gold Rush Motherlode). It didn’t take too much convincing for me to join her. I’ve tackled long treks before, but never 50. We started out with 100 other participants at 7am on a Saturday, and finished 71st & 72nd after 12:50 on the trails. It was a difficult event for sure, but having my teammate to share stories with the whole time made the miles fly by. Surprised at how good I felt at the end….that picture is actually from the finish!
