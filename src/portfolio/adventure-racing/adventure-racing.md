I’ve always had a love for the wilderness, and a childlike sense of adventure. As I grew up, camping on family trips evolved into solo backpacking excursions. Exploratory bike rides in suburbia evolved into epic mountain bike rides in the Sierras. Running on the soccer field evolved into running off trail at orienteering events. Adventure Racing quickly became my passion, and pushing myself to my limits with teammates at events brought me a sense of accomplishment, and connection to this world that is hard to get any other way. I’m a problem solver by nature, and have a strong spirit, a skill set that has helped me countless times navigate and endure these races.

***What is Adventure Racing?*** Adventure racing is a combination of two or more endurance disciplines, including orienteering/navigation, cross-country running, mountain biking, paddling, climbing and related rope skills. An expedition event can span ten days or more while sprints can be completed in a matter of hours. Shorter races can be raced solo, or with a team, typically up to 4 people. Longer races are typically raced with teams of 2-4 people.

I began racing in 2008 with close friends. We first took on several local races, ranging from urban to full on wilderness races. In 2009 I began racing with a local bay are team, [Racing With Giants](http://www.racingwithgiants.com/ "Racing With Giants"). Racing With Giants developed me into an adept kayaker, and taught me how to race through the night. My first 24hr races, and multi-day races were with this team. In 2012 I joined Team Tecnu. A local bay area team with world class racers, and world class sponsors. This new team has given me an opportunity to racer harder, faster, and is opening new racing opportunities across the country.

Adventure Racing is often a difficult sport to explain, one good way to explain it is with a few videos of some my training events. Below is a video of a training day near Mt Tamalpais in Marin County, North of San Francisco.
