After a few missteps, setbacks, I finally had enough time to implement PDMWorks Enterprise at Ardica Technologies. Being a small startup, we managed fine on most of our projects just saving and sharing files over a networked drive. But, as we crunched our timelines, and began working even more closely with our CAD, we needed a stronger solution to sharing and working with the same CAD assemblies and parts. I lead a small team (me and one of my coworkers) to roll out a PDMWorks Enterprise solution for managing our CAD data. There were a few hiccups after roll out, but itâ€™s been clear to see the benefits as well!
