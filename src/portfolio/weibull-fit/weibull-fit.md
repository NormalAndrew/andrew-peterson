During my time designing pipettor heads for Molecular Devices, I quickly became well versed in characterizing fluidics performance in terms of accuracy and precision. I took my knowledge one step further as I began to amass test data, realizing that the distribution of results (in this case, precision results) matched that of a Weibull distribution. Once I made that association, I was able to characterize with high degree of confidence how my design would perform over time.

I didn’t always enjoy statistics in university…but once I was able to apply it to real world engineer problems, I realized how much I enjoyed it’s ability to inform.
