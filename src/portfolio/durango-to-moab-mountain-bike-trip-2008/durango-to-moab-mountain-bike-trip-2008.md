In the summer of 2008 a few friends and I set off on a seven day hut to hut trip between Durango, Colorado and Moab, Utah. It was an amazing trip full of breathtaking views, strenuous biking, flowing long stretches of single track, and plenty of good times. The total trip was about 215miles, and roughly 26,000ft of climbing. Luckily weâ€™d reach a fully stocked cabin each night, ready to devour food, and drink a few beers.
