I’ve had the fortune of helping out my good friend and kinetic sculptor Matt Jones out with a few projects over the years. In 2008 he was commissioned to do a piece for a home, and was inspired to create a wooden fabric wall that undulates with the freeway traffic it overlooks. I stepped in and helped him design the pneumatic system to drive this undulating wall. Was a really fun departure from my typical work, specifying the appropriate size pneumatics, valving, and air compressor to drive it all. Feel free to check it out in action [here](http://www.ojdingo.com/videos/traffic_wave_installed_fast.mov "Traffic Wave").

I’d highly suggest checking out Matts website and interesting portfolio [here](http://www.ojdingo.com/ "Matt Jones").
