In the summer of 2000 I had an internship at John Deere Harvester Works in East Moline, Illinois for 3 months. I worked within their Supply Management division on supplier quality issues. During this time I created a Gage R&amp;R (Repeatability and Reproducibility) excel spreadsheet that could be used both internally and amongst John Deere suppliers to determine whether their measurement system (both Gages and Appraisers) is acceptable, and have a suitable resolution to meet design tolerances. I worked with a supplier developing a control plan to bring them inline with John Deereâ€™s Supplier Quality Manual. I also worked on some supplier warranty reclamation, managing to recover $142,000 in my short time there. This last bit of work resulted in John Deere creating a new full time position for warranty reclamation.
