One of my first assignments at Molecular Devices was to redesign their 12 channel automated pipettor design for the IonWorks HT (high-throughput) electrophysiology test platform. This project was a fantastic learning experience. It took several iterations to finally reach a suitable solution, which delivered much improved precision and accuracy performance. I worked closely with a new vendor to design a custom syringe solution for our design, and worked closely with our own production and service groups to arrive at a robust, easily assembled, easily serviced design.
