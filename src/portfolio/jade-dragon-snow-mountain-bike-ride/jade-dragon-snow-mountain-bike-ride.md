In December of 2010 I joined Pierre Le Magnan (Chiru Bike Founder, Adventure Racer), Julien Lallemand (Photographer, Adventure Racer), and Fai Wong Ho (Photographer) on a 3 day mountain bike around Jade Dragon Snow Mountain in Yunan Province, China. This 3 day expedition turned into quite the adventure, travelling over passes and through villages never visited before on mountain bike. It was amazing to see simple villages with subsistance farmers at elevations and in terrain I wouldnâ€™t not have thought possible. This 18, 630ft mountain, that stretched for miles was the most breathtaking peak I had ever seen. Not to mention we got to travel along the Tiger Leaping Gorge, one of the worlds deepest canyons. The weather was cold each day, and we were pressed each day to make our distance. We were following a rough path Pierre had mapped out on Google Earth, so needless to say, there was a lot of talking with locals to find a route. Our last day started with a 40km climb that took us above 10,000ft, and took us over 4hrs.

Julien Lallemand produced this great video summarizing our trip.
